# Minimalism

- [Things](things)

For a long time I wanted to pursue minimalism.
Minimalism doesn’t mean to have the best of each.
Even if I already had something functional, if it wasn’t aesthetically pleasing or didn’t match with my existing gear, I always looked out for replacing that item with a better one. Be it shoes or an office chair.

## Going furniture-free

One fine day I was looking for the best ergonomic chair, I came across a floor desk setup. This intrigued me as I had multiple reasons to try this out.

- even with a smaller desk, you can extend your desk space to the entire floor
- small surface area implies less area for dust to accumulate
- forced mobility due to pins-and-needles in long seated position (bye-bye pomodoros)

Now all that I have in my room is a tiny floor desk, a floor mat, a cushion, a mattress and a cupboard. It takes me less than 10 minutes to empty my room, clean it and reorganize it.
