# Work Over Self

Slice off Life
Life's much easier to manage when things are organised.
I try to categorise most of the stuff into one of the below four:
    work
    over
    self
    rest
I also use these categories to allocate intervals based on the time of the da for the tasks of each category.
The 24 hours of each day are divided equally into these categories again
    Work (of two hours interval thrice a day)
    Over (of one hour interval six times a day)
    Self (of two hours interval thrice a day)
    Rest (of six hours interval once a day)
Mapping the above on the clock it looks something like this
