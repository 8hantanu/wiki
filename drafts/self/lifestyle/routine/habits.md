### Practice

I have previously read classical works by Stoic scholars. Yet, whenever reality later hit me, I would go back to my old self - someone who couldn’t control her temper, someone that felt anxious about uncertainty, and someone that was frequently swayed by passions.

I sincerely thought that I believed in Stoic ideas, yet there seemed to be an unconquerable divide between what I believed and and what I did. Was I a hypocrite? Was I too weak mentally? What prevented me from putting these principles into practice?

This books provides an answer. Only through repeated, intentional, and regular practices could I truly become a Stoic, or at least start becoming one.

Just like my muscles need regular exercise, so my mind similarly needs mental exercise. Reading Stoic writings made me feel good, but I couldn’t stop there. My feelings were only temporary. It needed solid soil to flourish. Without purposeful reflections and daily practices, the inspirations that these writings brought to me would soon fizzle out. Yet, I naively thought that just because I read these verses, they then automatically became part of me.

I have just finished the introductions to weekly follow-up practices.I look forward to re-learning Stoicism, throughout 2021, via the book’s daily practices.
