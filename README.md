# Shantanu's wiki 📖

This wiki documents my notes and some useful stuff I come across. I also curate some of my ideas, experiences, and creations here as well.

The pages are categorized into ([_why?_](self/lifestyle/work-over-self)):

- 🌱 **[work](work)**
- ☀️ **[over](over)**
- 🌺 **[self](self)**

I've poured my heart and soul into curating this space. I hope you find it both enjoyable and relevant. 😊
