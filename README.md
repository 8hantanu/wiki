# shantanu's wiki

I am always struggling to retain my learnings. So this wiki was started to
document my notes and some useful stuff I come across. I also curate some of my
ideas, reviews, and creations here as well. The posts are categorized into one of
the following types:

- [work](work)
- [over](over)
- [self](self)

I hope the content is enjoyable and relevant to you as well. Also read [disclaimer](rest/disclaimer).
