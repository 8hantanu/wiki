# shantanu's wiki

This wiki documents my notes and some useful stuff I come across. I also curate some of my ideas, experiences, and creations here as well.

The pages are categorized into:

- **[work](work)** — notes and projects
- **[over](over)** — random stuff
- **[self](self)** — experiences and lifestyle

See [_why?_](self/lifestyle/work-over-self)

I've poured my heart and soul into curating this space. I hope you find it both enjoyable and relevant.
