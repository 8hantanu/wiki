# Shantanu's wiki 📚

This wiki documents my notes and some useful stuff I come across. I also curate some of my
ideas, experiences, and creations here as well. The posts are categorized into:

- **🌱 [work](work)**
- **☀️ [over](over)**
- **🌺 [self](self)**

I've poured my heart and soul into curating this space. I hope you find it both enjoyable and relevant. 😊
