## Fear

Change the role of fear from controlling to commentating on your life

Recognize and understand your fear.
Avoidance prevents you from discovering whether the risk is real, and robs you of a learning experience.
Try this reflection on your own life. Start by drawing a horizontal line on a blank page, with your date of birth at one end and today at the other. Mark it out into 5-year chunks. Above the line, write down the important events that happened in each period. Below the line, comment on how these events have shaped your fear. Take as long as you need.

Next, look at your timeline as if you’re an outsider. Do you see any patterns or themes? Are there clear episodes related to fear? Are there stories that continue from childhood to the present day? Are these truths?

Externalizing your own story allows you to examine how fear uses the past to tell you about now rather than evaluating now from a less biased viewpoint. If you understand this, you can begin to separate fear’s message from the fear itself. And you’ll stay in the present, focusing on what you want rather than listening to fear.

Imagine that you no longer listen to your fear and tomorrow you suddenly find yourself more courageous. How would your day begin differently from today? How would people react to the new you? What would they see in you that makes them realize you’re more courageous? How does this “new you” think? And what could you now achieve?This is the key message: Decide to be courageous, and create a contract with your fear.
T ake some time to reflect on your goals in various aspects of your life and write them down. What are your work goals? Perhaps you see yourself in the top job one day. Do you have social goals? Maybe you’d like more friends or deeper relationships. What about fun goals like surfing Maui or trekking in the Amazon – or even something a little less dangerous, like baking your own bread? What are your well-being goals – eating three helpings of fruit per day or making sure you’re doing some movement every day, for example. Add in your financial goals – maybe investing an amount of money; and your learning goals – like enrolling in a photography course, or learning a new language.

Make sure each goal you want to concentrate on is SMART – that is, Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-sensitive. Think about what fear says about them. Ask yourself how your goals would be different if fear wasn’t involved.

When you choose a behavior that fear doesn’t like, you put yourself in the driver’s seat. Gradually increasing the discomfort you feel allows you to countermand fear’s choices. To do this, draw up a plan with steps 1 to 10 – where you are now is 1, and where you want to be is 10. Fill in the gaps making each step a little more challenging than the last. Overcoming your discomfort each time will bring more and more confidence

## Risk

Nowadays, her preferred term isn’t risk, but a word with more positive connotations: hope" in You Are What You Risk by Michele Wucker

## Breaks

Researchers from Harvard Business School identified four typical types of pauses. Type one is the social break – like talking to your coworkers. Then, there’s the nutritional break that often involves a snack and maybe a glass of water. The relaxation break is time spent daydreaming or doing gentle exercise. Finally, there are cognition breaks, where you read a book or browse social media.

## Time

T is treasured time; I is investment time; M is mandatory time; and E is empty time. And once you start to break down your day into those four categories, you’re a big step closer to becoming extremely productive.

The key message here is: Extremely productive people manage their time better – and so can you.

Treasured time is what it sounds like: it’s the time that’s most special to you on a personal level. For Mike and Erica, this was often the time they spent with Ari, watching hockey on the hospital television, or playing baseball in the play area. But they also treasured the time they spent in jujitsu class, or in front of Grey’s Anatomy with a cold beer. Don’t just think of this as time off – think of it as time to cherish.

Investment time generates returns that exceed the work you put in – just like a financial investment. When you take investment time seriously, you’ll start to see new possibilities and opportunities for expansion. It’s where you should look to spend most of your work time.

Mandatory time is time doing the day-to-day things you feel you have to do, even if you don’t want to. You should try to minimize mandatory time. Some of it you can – and should – outsource. Some of it you might be able to turn into investment time. Your daily commute, for instance: stick on a relevant podcast, and a mandatory activity becomes an investment.

Empty time is wasted time. Surfing the web, checking social media, staring into space. This one’s easy: just cut it back. Eliminate it altogether if you can – it adds nothing.

All that might sound easier said than done. But the truth is, it’s easier than you probably think to craft a new routine for yourself in which you can maximize treasured and investment time and minimize mandatory and empty time.
