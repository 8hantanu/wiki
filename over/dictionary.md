## blue table

***/bluː ˈteɪbəl/***

**noun**

**1.** The single best seating location discovered during a trip or journey, characterized by an optimal combination of ambiance, view, and serendipitous timing.

> *"We stumbled upon our blue table at a café overlooking the valley, and suddenly the entire day made sense."*

**Origin:** Personal coinage, termed during Shantanu's travels. Named for the frequent association with blue elements in the environment (bodies of water, sky) or the furniture itself.

**Usage notes:**
- A blue table cannot be planned or sought; it reveals itself spontaneously to the traveler.
- Only one blue table exists per trip; no two locations can share this designation, as each represents a unique peak experience.
- The discovery of a blue table marks a moment of perfect confluence between place, circumstance, and appreciation.
