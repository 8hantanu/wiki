We come from [Chitkul](../chitkul#2024-10-14) and make a pit stop to see the Nako lake in the Hangreng valley.

The elderly are doing their bhajan.

I make a friend with a cow and do some nice bird watching.

Their bhajan ends, and they head back to the villages. Along the way, the elderly greet us with "Juley" (which means hello in their native tongue).
