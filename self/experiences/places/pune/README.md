__

We reached moregaon once again, this time a queue as it was a weekend. We finally had the darshan completing the Ashta vinaayak circuit. 

And finally headed back to Pune to get on our bus to Hyderabad.

02 Siddhatek 

on the way saw lots of sugarcane fields and trucks filled with load of sugarcane
situated on the banks of the bhim river
there is a beautiful bridge leading to the temple
had a gulchal chaha 
did the darshan
saw a meals place just beside before the bridge, served traditional meals on floor
missed the late lunch as it was very less time to reach the bhuleshwar temple

—

The winding roads at the end lead us to the bhuleshwar temple, it was just before the sunset

the pillars and walls were majestic, many idols broken from the past.

saw the dusk from the temple premises 

stoped by a nearby restaurant ___ the food was great, played with a catto at the restaurant 

left for pune
  03 Pali

left early in the morning for Pali (Ballaleshwar)
the drive was fantastic
mumbai pune road first time in a car 

it was misty with light droplets of rain sometimes

clouds swaying by the ground, roads all wet and forming an acrylic mirror as we passed lonavla
spotted two ladies from afar wanted to take a nice shot and luckily i did

made a pitstop on the way to have some wadapavs, they had the perfect crunch to softness ratio that i had to get three of them 

at 0900 we reached the temple premises

as soon as we stepped out the sun shone bright no sign of rain or clouds as if welcoming our arrival 

watch out for the missal man 

after darshan headed for mahad


04 Mahad

started the drive again towards lonavla for mahad

this time it was quite the opposite it started raining heavily as we stepped out

the first temple where i encountered the queue 

after an hour we had the darshan 

there were some geese around cackling 

finally i saw a shop of og modak (boiled ones) a lady carefully making each modak 

just so you know how they are served 

pop a lid drop a modak on a bowl
and then cut it open and fill it with nice ghee

every bite is flavorful euphoria

i had one then two and then two more, finally what i was looking for

then back on the road for 


05 Theur

this was close to pune 

the chintamani ganesh

the only temple i felt was a bit off the circuit 

the traffic was so bad as we got back on the mumbai-pune expressway but the view was good

also the tunnels were pretty

We reached the temple did a quick darshan

For some snacks we stopped by to have some missal pav and we had so many of it as it was so tasty and we were famished

We started heading to lenyadri.


06 Lenyadri

On the way to lenyadri we had to crosss nareshgaom anfd boy oh boy we got stuck so bad

So there was a two way road which was under construction, only one way was operational and there were all vehicles clammed there. 

We were stuck as the oncoming traffic just 

I had to get out redirect and also there were spikes steel rods poking off the cement road

Somehow we made it out and headed to junnar. In junnar we had to cross a reach lenyadri but that bridge was in the dark and looked as if it lead to nowhere, it was super pitch black, we turned o
Around to get to the main road and went back from behind a small detour.

We could see the caves in the night it was pretty.

We had to find a room to no avail we couldn’t find any, finally we went to the hotel to which I had already called said reserved but we still got one room.

The next morning we woke up at 0600 and reached the temple premises at 0730. It was a small climb or 300 steps, with monkeys along the way.

To enter the main temple it was such a mess, people couldn’t organize themselves in a line, pushing and heaving, there were some sensible people who insisted on forming a queue but no heed paid to them.

There was a single police man managing this bottleneck, getting drenched while managing the crowd to lead inside.

We somehow made it through this crowd being a part of this commotion. It took us another 20 min to get in, the temple reminded me of the ellora caves.

On the way back that crowd became sensible and formed a queue 

There was also a Buddhist stupa in one of the caves in the lower level.

On the way down we had tasty ginger tea and vada pav from a tapri managed by an old couple and we then we headed to ozar just a few km away.


07 Ozar

On the way we saw plenty flower fields, quite pretty with the backdrop of hills

Since ozar is in junnar district we saw many such shivaji statues 

The temple campus is situated along the banks of Yadgaon reservoir

The ozar temple seemed to be the most organized compared to all the previous visit.

After darshan we filled ourselves with some tasty wada pavs again these were the best ones we had, the wadas were being freshly cooked and we said to keep em coming

Now we had another long drive to reach ranjangaon 


08 Ranjangaon

We arrived at ranjangaon and opted for a ticketed darshan as we also had to morrgaon again

We were quickly done with the darshan and saw that there was a bhojanam Prasad going on.

We were unable to have it in others due to time constraints but as they say according to the lord wishes. I think we were made to wait till we finish the final darshan,

We had the lunch of lentils rice and a halwa. And then headed to the start of the circuit moregaon.
