## the spiti-kinnaur trail

### 2024-10-12

We arrive from [Shimla](../shimla#2024-10-12) and stay at Eskape Camps at Rakchham, a few kilometers before Chitkul. We sit around the campfire and hear war stories. We have a scrumptious dinner of healthy soup and homely made food.

I go for an early morning walk with PS Negi.

He talks about many things about his stories, plants, life. We pass an old cottage along the way.

I see the first light hitting the mountain top.

There are fluffy mountain dogs around.

I explore around the camp and find a glacial stream.

We have parathas, toast, and fruits for breakfast. Then we head towards Chitkul, termed "India's last village," for a day trip. The highlights are the Baspa River bridge, the Indo-Tibet border, and momos from a small village shop.

We return to camp for a late-afternoon siesta.

We have some fun banter with the group in the tent late into the night.

We leave for Spiti in the morning. I have a sore throat.

We see the Khab Sangam on the way—the confluence of the Spiti and Sutlej rivers. We have maggi and siddu (a traditional Himachali bun) at the sangam.

The roads and views along the way are amazing. We make a pit stop at [Nako](../nako#2024-10-14).
