Ajmer-Pushkar 23/02

Decided to get down at Ajmer  instead of Pushkar at 1500 as the Jain temple closes at 1700.

We saw the Jain museum where there was a whole city made of gold. 
Didn’t allow us inside the main temple as it was for the Jain people. We insisted … but looked from outside and proceeded.

Headed towards pushkar and I was in awe that the Ajmer was surrounded by hills (wasnt familiar with the geography). We reached the pushkar Brahma temple within 30 min.

Decided to have lunch before proceeding to darshan. Had tamater sev for the first time and it was good. 

Then proceeded through the streets towards the Brahms Temple saw many artisans working on their art, be it leather stone etc. entered the temple, the temple had all tiles donated by some one.

After coming from the temple had a nice tea from a tea vendor selling tea on a tripod. This tea had a spice mix sprinkled over the tea.

Then we headed to the ___ mandir but midway decided to skip it as we would be late for other things in Ajmer.

I went to the sarovar/ghat and sat for a few minutes. 

Then we made a stop at a gurudwara we saw on our way to the Brahma temple.

Then headed back to Ajmer, stopped at the seven wonder park on the way.

The highlight was the sunset on the Mansagar lake, setting behind the mountains. 

We went to the darga sharif, the streets leading to it were quite lively and well lit.  it was DS first time visiting a darga. But on the way back our slippers were gone. We walked bare feet till our auto and then stopped by at a local foot wear store and replaced my lost/stolen Birkenstock dipes with a Nike slide dupes.

We stopped by to have some snacks, I decided to have mawa kachori and turned out the whole thing was sweet c it was so heavy I didn’t feel like having dinner.

We came to the railway station at around 2100 and our trains was at 2200.

We got on the train and prepared to sleep.

I forgot I had booked a sleeper instead of ac coach so we didn’t have any blankets to cover ourselves, it was quite chilly through out the night and I couldn’t sleep.


Udaipur 24/02

We reached Udaipur on time, it was the last stop and there were only thr three of us still sleeping in the train. 

The guy responsible for switching off the mcbs in the train woke us up and told us to leave.

We went to the retirement room all dreary which has the checkin time of 0800.

We just went to see if it could be done early, but there was no one, a room was empty and we figured let’s sleep. We completed our remaining sleep till 0800 woken up by the retirement room guy.

We got ready and left around 0930 for Jagdish temple.the streets to the temple from railway station was residential. The temple was beautiful.

We headed to the city palace and had breakfast there matar kulcha and karam iidli. The city palace was very well organized and easy to navigate. And I liked it better than the Jaipur city palace. 

Then we walked to the boating point at lake Pichola and took a boat ride to the jalmandit which I didn’t feel was worth the price. The boat ride was to a lunch place of all overpriced restaurant in the middle of the lake pichola. The return ride we got a front seat and the return journey was quite breezy. 

We decided to walk to the cable car for Tarmi Mara temple. The cable car ride was short and fun with the entire city view and leading to an even bettter panoramic view from the top point near the temple. This seemed to be the best sunset point but were 3 hours early. On the way back the cable car ride wait was 2 long almost 30 min to get into a car

We took an auto to sahiom ki badi. It was a little underwhelming. And we missed Sajjanfort/ palace. That would’ve have been a better choice and we could see the sunset. 

Then we decided we will walk to Ambrai ghat. On our way to ambrai ghat we saw a moto cafe. This was one of the hidden gems of the trip. Sameer gave us a nice tour and told us about all of the bikes. It was a fun experience and this was the first time I saw something of this kind. He showed us around for an hour.

 we decided we better pick our luggage first then head to ambrai ghat. As it was closed we went to the Ambrai restaurant.

The steeets were narrow anid lively filled with displays of the works of the artisans and the 


Ambrose restaurant was closed and then we went to the blue moon roof top the vie of everything at this time was, to was very pretty and we relaxed there sipping cold coffee till it was time for our bus to Jodhpur.

On reaching the bus station we came to know that our bus was canceled. The person in the booth helped us book a ticket in an ac seater bus which was only available at that moment and we heeded to Jodhpur.

Jodhpur 25/02

We reached Jodhpur early in the at 0530 and went to Zostel Ratnada and slept till 0800 in the morning. 

This time we booked a rental headed out to have breakfast in an artsy cafe and also see the kund. We had a nice breakfast of a vegan omelette and club sandwich with soy milk hot chocolate and cappuccino. Near the kund we saw a boy jump directly into the kund which was atleast 5-stores deep, that was something. 

From there we headed to the cenotaphs, we were a little lost to get to the road to the main road but with the help of locals we made it. The road is quite steep and had DS get down to get to the main road. From here we could see the beautiful view of the blue city and headed to the cenotaph. 

At the entrance there was a statue of the ___. As we made into the cenotaphs we were welcomed by the cool breeze of the the lake and the melodies of the tanpura. These are also called as the Taj Mahal of ____.

We decided to head to the mandora village nearby, it’s a pretty old village which houses temples, forts, cenotaphs of the kings there. The road to there was scenic.

Reaching there we saw many monkeys there. We first decided to look around before heading to the main temples. We saw smaller temples of multiple gods, walked along the fort walls, saw a temple of ____ where we had to crawl through a 2ft x 2ft tunnel to reach outside (it was an old temple of their ancestor), saw the ruins of a 1500 year old Brahma temple, and then the 6 temples which were an improvement over the previous temples. We had a lunch of Dahi Kachori and bhel.

We then headed to Mehangarh fort. Most of the fort was closed but we there were many things in the museum. It also had a steep climb. It was cloudy and from there we saw the sun set. 

We decided to go have some traditional dinner near Uamid Mahal at ___ Mahal. But it was closed unfortunately. But we found a good homestay restaurant with the best view of the clock tower and the fort. To have the seat with the best view we decided to wait and then I had Gilman Jamin ki sabzi and Kee Samgri with Bajre ki Roti for the first time. We sat there for a while and then headed back to our stay at Zostel Ratnada. We slept early as we had to catch an early bus to jaisalmer.

Jaisalmer 26/02

We took a bus at the the Ashoka chakra in Jodhpur to reach Jaisalmer. This bus was the first that gave us the feeling of being in a proper rural bus (after Jaipur-Pushkar bus). Having a ticket doesn’t guarantee you a seat. I somehow slept through the journey being woken up by the conductor multiple times. 

After we reached jaisalmer we again decided to rent a scooty and we headed straight to Sam desert. 

On the way we saw multiple windmills and we saw a throne made of stones and took a seat. We also saw an ATV  and decided to take a ride. After an hour on the bike we reached Zostel Sam Desert. We decided to stay on the mud cottage dorm as it was cooler than the tent dorm.

We headed out to the small dunes we could see from our place and had a camel ride there. It was too much fun. Irfan and sameer had badal and raja. I asked sameer if he could ride it and then when the camel started sprinting that was most fun. We met vishnuji.

We came back and took a “jeep safari” headed to the dunes. It was 5km away from our place and there were dunes but it was highly commercialized. We walked till the end of the dunes and saw the sun set. 

After that there was evening welcome and snacks followed by the cultural show and dinner. 

After we saw the many stars in the sky and decided to go alone to the dunes. We weren’t able to go to the dunes as our scooty tires weren’t able to handle the sand but we saw a small hillock nearby and decided to go there. Turned out it was even worse spot as there was light bleed from all the resorts around. On the way down we weren’t able to find our scooty as we hadn’t seen in which direction we had parked the scooty and walked around the hill to find it.

We came back took a shower and dozed.


Jaisalmer 27/02

We woke up late and lazy at 1000 and then had a light breakfast of some tea and toast and headed to Jaisalmer making stops at Khaba and Kuldhara,
