## the spiti-kinnaur trail

### 2024-10-12

I arrive from [Delhi](../delhi#2024-10-11) at dawn.

*Shimla at dawn*

I meet the gang here, the group I'll spend the rest of this trip with.

*Gang at the Gate*

We head to [chitkul](../chitkul#2024-10-12). The valley views on the way are stunning.

We reach back to Shimla at 1800 from [Kalpa](../kinnaur#2024-10-19).

I see many rocks falling and blocking the road throughout the trip, but this one is the biggest.

*...there is a way*

I bid farewell to the group.

*The Dusk Bids Adieu*

I board the bus to [Delhi](../delhi#2024-10-20) (another long, tiring journey) at 2100.
