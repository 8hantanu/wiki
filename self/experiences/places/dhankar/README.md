### 2024-10-15

We come from [Tabo](../tabo#2024-10-15). The Spiti River runs along the route.

There are rock formations created by the wind.

On the way, there's an isolated suspension footbridge that leads to the Mane village.

The bridge is made of planks that aren't bolted on quite well. Each step has to be careful.

*Fun exercise*

I spend some time relaxing on the bridge, soaking in the view.

Then we head to the new Dhankar monastery. There are cool doors around.

We have lunch there, and I order Thukpa for my sore throat.

Just a little atop the Dhankar monastery, there's a 180-degree panoramic viewpoint of the whole valley.

It's a little climb, but due to fever and slight weakness, I have to catch my breath every few minutes.

But the climb is worth it for the view.

We head to [kaza](../kaza#2024-10-15).
