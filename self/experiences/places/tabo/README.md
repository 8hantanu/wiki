*Welcome to Spiti*

We reach Tabo at 1800, after starting from Nako.

*This is how we rolled*

I attempt to take the traveler photo at night. It turns out to be a cool wallpaper.

Our stay is at White Lotus, a cozy homestay in the Tabo village.

*We were tired*

The stay is pretty and cozy.

My throat, along with my voice, is all gone. Our guide Gyallson makes sure I'm served hot drinks throughout, starting with hot tea with saunf flavor, then lemon honey ginger tea.

We have a homely dinner. Then everyone gathers for the game of mafia. This is my first time being introduced to the game, and it turns out I'm great at manipulating people into believing and vouching for me. Lots of convincing with my messed-up throat during the game makes it worse.

I decide to stay up late to stargaze.

I wake up to the view of mountains from my window with a slightly better throat but a mild fever.

![woah](woah.avif)
*Look at that view*

While having breakfast, I see lots of bees and flowers.

*Of bees*

There's an apple tree nearby.

A ten-minute walk away is the Tabo monastery, one of the oldest and considered the most sacred site in Buddhism. The walk to the monastery is through fields and streams. I see a few donkeys seeking shade.

*Yo it was hot*

There are multiple apple trees along the route, filled with more apples than leaves.

The inside of Tabo monastery can be described as sanctum.

*Tabo Monastery*

Beautiful murals completely cover the walls of the monastery.

*New Monastery*

There are multiple idols on the walls of the monastery that seem as if they would animate to life any moment. The hands on these idols are very realistically portrayed.

There's a beautiful house beside the monastery.

*Pretty house*

I buy a skull band and necklace made out of yak bone. A memento mori.

From here, we head towards Kaza. On the way, we stop at [Dhankar](../dhankar#2024-10-15).
