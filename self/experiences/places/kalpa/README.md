# Kalpa

## The Spiti-Kinnaur Trail

### 2024-10-18

- The road to Kalpa from [kaza](../kaza#2024-10-18) was filled with beautiful views
- All the way all I could see was trucks and tempos filled with boxes of apples
- At 17:00 we reached Zostel Kalpa
  - The rooms at Kalpa were a luxury
- From there we could see the mountain of Kinnaur Kailash(which we didnt see until next morning)
- I went to the terrace to see the sunset and the sky was a beautiful hue of orange

- The zostel turned pretty with lights after dusl

- There was a snooker table and we had few games along with snacks and turned out Gyalli was a pro at pool

- It was late and I went to sleep at 05:00 in the morning
