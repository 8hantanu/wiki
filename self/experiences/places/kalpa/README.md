## the spiti-kinnaur trail

### 2024-10-18

The road to Kalpa from [kaza](../kaza#2024-10-18) is filled with beautiful views. All the way, all I can see are trucks and tempos filled with boxes of apples.

At 1700, we reach Zostel Kalpa. The rooms at Kalpa are a luxury. From there, we can see the mountain of Kinnaur Kailash (which we don't actually see until the next morning).

I go to the terrace to see the sunset. The sky is a beautiful hue of orange.

The Zostel turns pretty with lights after dusk.

There's a snooker table, and we have a few games along with snacks. It turns out Gyalli is a pro at pool.

We have dinner. The group gathers as it's the last day, and we play the last mafia game. It's late, and I go to sleep at 0500 in the morning.

I wake up at 0730, all sleep-deprived. Everyone is packed and ready to leave for Shimla.

We start looking at the Kinnaur Kailash. Apal's camera scopes it.

We leave for Shimla at 1100—a day-long journey.

I sleep throughout the journey for the most part, except stopping and waking up for lunch.

We reach [Shimla](../shimla#2024-10-19) in the evening.
