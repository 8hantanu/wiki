### 2024-10-17

We come from [kaza](../kaza#2024-10-17) and head to Chicham. The rivers wind like a caduceus.

On the way, there's the highest bridge in India, called the Chicham bridge.

The roads around Chicham are beautiful.

We reach Gyalli's village. I notice most homes there have a cozy dining layout where everyone is seated around the fireplace.

Gyalli serves us some hot tea—a relief to my sore throat.

They also have a pooja room that is very well decorated and sacred.

Then we head to Key monastery, the largest in the Spiti valley. The autumn colors are stunning.

It's a small climb, but with my health state, I dread it.

*Entry*

After reaching the top, I relax in one of the meditation rooms. There's also a tea room adjacent to the meditation room where I have some herbal tea served by the monks there. From a gift shop, I buy some solid fragrances along with a postcard.

Behind the monastery is a beautiful "three Buddha statue."

Just above it is a beautiful viewpoint (again, a dreaded climb) that's featured on the postcard.
