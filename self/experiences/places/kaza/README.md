We come from [dhankar](../dhankar#2024-10-15). At 1930, we reach Zostel Kaza, our stay for the next three nights. I have a lemon honey ginger tea since my fever and throat are getting worse.

The sky is pretty at night.

I decide to stay back while the group goes to visit the Hikkim post office and the Langza Buddha statue. 

I soak in the sun all day, with the street dog by my side to which I had fed my breakfast toast that I couldn't finish earlier.

I also have loads of lemon honey ginger tea and long siestas.

I start feeling a little better but am still not completely recovered. I decide to join the group. We head for [chicham](../chicham#2024-10-17), our guide Gyallson's village.

On our way back, we go to the Kaza market.

I buy a set of little porcelain cups and a Tibetan singing bowl. We have our dinner at Himalayan Cafe—tingmo with shapta and hot chocolate.

Surprisingly, the Kaza market is quite near the Zostel. I come back and sleep.

A new day, and I'm feeling the best I've felt since I fell sick. By 10:30, I've had my breakfast sandwiches, and we head for Kalpa.

When the van stops for a break, I just start walking towards Kalpa. At one point, I look around—there's no sight of the van or any other vehicles. It's just me and the mountains. It's serene, peaceful.

At around 1400, we stop for lunch, and I have some momos.

In the late afternoon, we're in [Kalpa](../kalpa#2024-10-18).
