## The Spiti Valley üèû
### 2024-10-14

- Reached spiti at 1800, after we had started from [Kinnaur](kinnaur#2024-10-14)
- our stay was at White Lotus, a cozy homestay in the Tabo village
- my throat along with my voice was all gone, and our guide Gyallson made sure I was served hot drinks throughout
  - started with a hot tea with saunf flavor
  - then had lemon honey ginger tea
- had a homely dinner again
- then everyone gathered around for the game of mafia
  - this was first time i was introduced to the game
  - and turns out I am great at manipulating people into believing/vouch for me
  - lots of convincing with my F'ed up throat during the game made it worse
- decided to stay up late to stargaze

- woke up to the view of mountains from my window with slightly better throat but mild fever
- a ten minute walk away was the tabo monastery (one of the oldest and considered the most sacred site in buddhism)
  - the walk to monastery was through fields and streams
  - multiple apple trees along the routes filled with more apples than leaves
- the inside of tabo monastery can be described as sanctum
  - beautiful murals completely covering the walls of monastery
  - there were multiple idols on the walls of the monastery which seemed as if they would animate to life any moment
  - the hands on these idols were very realistically portrayed
- bought a skull band and necklace made out of yak bone, a memento mori
- from here we headed towards Kaza
- on the way there was a isolated suspension foot bridge which lead to the Mane village
  - spent some time there relaxing on the bridge soaking in the view
- then we headed to Dhankar monastery where we had lunch and I ordered Thukpa for my sore throat
- just a little atop the Dhankar monastery there was a 180 degree panoramic view point of the whole valley
  - it was a little climb but due to fever and a slight weakness i had to catch wait to catch my breath every few minutes but the climb was worth it for the view
- At 1930 we reached Zostel Kaza out stay for the next three nights
  - had a lemon honey ginger tea since my fever and throat was getting worse

- I decided to stay back while the group went on to visit the hikkim post office and the Langza buddha statue
- I soaked in the sun all day, with the street dog by my side to which I had fed earlier my breakfast toasts that I couldnt finish 
- Also had load of the lemon honey ginger tea and long siestas

## 2024-10-17

- I started feeling a little better but still not completely recovered, I decided to join the group
- We headed for Chicham, our guide Gyallson's village
- On the way there was the highest bridge in Asia called the Chicham bridge
- We reached Gyalli's village
  - I noticed most homes there have a cozy dining layout where everyone is seated around the fireplace
  - Gyalli served us some hot tea, a relief to my sore throat
  - they had also had a pooja room which was very well decorated and sacred
- Then we headed to Key monastery the largest in the Spiti valley
  - It was a small climb but with my health state I dreaded that climb
  - After reaching the top I relaxed in one of the meditation rooms
  - There was also a tea room adjacent to the meditation room where I had some herbal tea served by the monks there
  - From a gift shop there I bought some solid fragrances along with a postcard
  - Behind the monastery is a beautiful "three buddha statue" and just above it a beautiful view point(again a dreaded climb)
- On our way back we went to the Kaza market
  - bought a set of little porcelain cups and a Tibetan singing bowl
  - had our dinner at Himalayan Cafe, had tingmo with shapta and hot chocolate
- Surprisingly the kaza market was quite near to the Zostel, came back and slept

- A new day and I was feeling the best I had felt since I fell sick
- By 10:30 I had my breakfast sandwiches and we headed for Kalpa
- In between when the van stopped for a break, I just started towards Kalpa, and at one point I looked around there was no sight of van, any other vehicles, it was just me and the mountains, it was serene, peaceful.
- At around 2 we stopped for lunch and I had some momos 
- in the late afternoon we were in [Kalpa](kinnaur#2024-10-18)
