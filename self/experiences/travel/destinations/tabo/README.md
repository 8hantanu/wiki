- my throat along with my voice was all gone, and our guide Gyallson made sure I was served hot drinks throughout
  - started with a hot tea with saunf flavor
  - then had lemon honey ginger tea
- had a homely dinner again
- then everyone gathered around for the game of mafia
  - this was first time i was introduced to the game
  - and turns out I am great at manipulating people into believing/vouch for me
  - lots of convincing with my F'ed up throat during the game made it worse
- decided to stay up late to stargaze
