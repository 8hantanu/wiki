- We headed to chicham
  ![The rivers be like...](caduceus.avif)
- On the way there was the highest bridge in India called the Chicham bridge
  ![Highest Bridge](chicham_bridge.avif)
  - On top of it
  ![On top](above.avif)
  - The roads around chicham were beautiful
  ![Finding waldo (chicham bridge edition)](roads.avif)
- We reached Gyalli's village
  - I noticed most homes there have a cozy dining layout where everyone is seated around the fireplace
  ![Living area](cozy.avif)
  - Gyalli served us some hot tea, a relief to my sore throat
  ![Utilities](decor.avif)
  - they had also had a pooja room which was very well decorated and sacred
  ![The shrine](shrine.avif)
- Then we headed to Key monastery the largest in the Spiti valley
  ![Yellow](autumn.avif)
  - It was a small climb but with my health state I dreaded that climb
  ![Entry](monastery.avif)
  - After reaching the top I relaxed in one of the meditation rooms
  - There was also a tea room adjacent to the meditation room where I had some herbal tea served by the monks there
  - From a gift shop there I bought some solid fragrances along with a postcard
  - Behind the monastery is a beautiful "three buddha statue" 
  ![Three Buddhas](buddhas.avif)
  - and just above it a beautiful view point(again a dreaded climb) which was on the postcard
