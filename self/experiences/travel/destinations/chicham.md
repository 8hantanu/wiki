- On the way there was the highest bridge in Asia called the Chicham bridge
- We reached Gyalli's village
  - I noticed most homes there have a cozy dining layout where everyone is seated around the fireplace
  - Gyalli served us some hot tea, a relief to my sore throat
  - they had also had a pooja room which was very well decorated and sacred
- Then we headed to Key monastery the largest in the Spiti valley
  - It was a small climb but with my health state I dreaded that climb
  - After reaching the top I relaxed in one of the meditation rooms
  - There was also a tea room adjacent to the meditation room where I had some herbal tea served by the monks there
  - From a gift shop there I bought some solid fragrances along with a postcard
  - Behind the monastery is a beautiful "three buddha statue" and just above it a beautiful view point(again a dreaded climb)
