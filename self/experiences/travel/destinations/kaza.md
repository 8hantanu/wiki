- I decided to stay back while the group went on to visit the hikkim post office and the Langza buddha statue
- I soaked in the sun all day, with the street dog by my side to which I had fed earlier my breakfast toasts that I couldnt finish 
- Also had load of the lemon honey ginger tea and long siestas

- I started feeling a little better but still not completely recovered, I decided to join the group
- We headed for [Chicham](chicham#2024-10-17), our guide Gyallson's village
- On our way back we went to the Kaza market
  - bought a set of little porcelain cups and a Tibetan singing bowl
  - had our dinner at Himalayan Cafe, had tingmo with shapta and hot chocolate
- Surprisingly the kaza market was quite near to the Zostel, came back and slept

## 2024-10-18

- A new day and I was feeling the best I had felt since I fell sick
- By 10:30 I had my breakfast sandwiches and we headed for Kalpa
- In between when the van stopped for a break, I just started towards Kalpa, and at one point I looked around there was no sight of van, any other vehicles, it was just me and the mountains, it was serene, peaceful.
- At around 2 we stopped for lunch and I had some momos 
- in the late afternoon we were in [Kalpa](kalpa#2024-10-18)
