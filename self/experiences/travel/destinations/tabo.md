# Tabo

## The Spiti-Kinnaur Trail

### 2024-10-14

- Reached Tabo at 1800, after we had started from [nako](nako#2024-10-14)
- our stay was at White Lotus, a cozy homestay in the Tabo village
- my throat along with my voice was all gone, and our guide Gyallson made sure I was served hot drinks throughout
  - started with a hot tea with saunf flavor
  - then had lemon honey ginger tea
- had a homely dinner again
- then everyone gathered around for the game of mafia
  - this was first time i was introduced to the game
  - and turns out I am great at manipulating people into believing/vouch for me
  - lots of convincing with my F'ed up throat during the game made it worse
- decided to stay up late to stargaze

- woke up to the view of mountains from my window with slightly better throat but mild fever
- a ten minute walk away was the tabo monastery (one of the oldest and considered the most sacred site in buddhism)
  - the walk to monastery was through fields and streams
  - multiple apple trees along the routes filled with more apples than leaves
- the inside of tabo monastery can be described as sanctum
  - beautiful murals completely covering the walls of monastery
  - there were multiple idols on the walls of the monastery which seemed as if they would animate to life any moment
  - the hands on these idols were very realistically portrayed
- bought a skull band and necklace made out of yak bone, a memento mori
- from here we headed towards Kaza, on the way stopped at [Dhankar](dhankar#2024-10-15)
