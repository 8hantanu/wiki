## The Spiti-Kinnaur Trail

### 2024-10-15

coming from [Tabo](tabo#2024-10-15)

- on the way there was a isolated suspension foot bridge which lead to the Mane village
  - spent some time there relaxing on the bridge soaking in the view
- then we headed to Dhankar monastery where we had lunch and I ordered Thukpa for my sore throat
- just a little atop the Dhankar monastery there was a 180 degree panoramic view point of the whole valley
  - it was a little climb but due to fever and a slight weakness i had to catch wait to catch my breath every few minutes but the climb was worth it for the view
- headed to [kaza](kaza#2024-10-15)
