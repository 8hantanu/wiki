## The Spiti-Kinnaur Trail

## 2024-10-18

- The road to Kalpa from [kaza](kaza#2024-10-18) was filled with beautiful views
- All the way all I could see was trucks and tempos filled with boxes of apples
- At 17:00 we reached Zostel Kalpa
  - The rooms at Kalpa were a luxury
- From there we could see the mountain of Kinnaur Kailash
- I went to the terrace to see the sunset and the sky was a beautiful hue of orange
- There was a snooker table and we had few games along with snacks and turned out Gyalli was a pro at pool
- We had dinner
- The group gathered as it was the last day and we played the last mafia game
- It was late and I went to sleep at 05:00 in the morning
