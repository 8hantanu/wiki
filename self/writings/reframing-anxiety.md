# Reframing Anxiety 🌿

Life’s pressures can weigh on us, especially when we’re navigating relationships, struggling with self-esteem, or feeling lost in our careers. In those moments, anxiety can spiral out of control, making everything seem worse than it is.

But here’s something powerful: you can become your own psychologist and work through these challenges by asking yourself three key questions. These questions come from _The Power of Pressure_ by Dane Jensen, and they are designed to help you reframe stressful situations and gain clarity.

Let’s break down these questions, and I’ll show you how they apply to real-life scenarios that many of us face—like relationship overthinking, feeling isolated in a new place, and struggling to find work.

## The 3 Questions to Manage Anxiety ❓

1. **What’s Truly at Stake?**

   Anxiety often exaggerates the stakes of a situation, making us feel like we’re facing disaster. To stop this spiral, ask yourself: _What hard evidence do I have that this situation will end badly? What’s really at risk here?_

2. **What Would I Tell a Friend?**

   We tend to be far kinder and more rational with friends than we are with ourselves. Ask: _If someone I cared about was going through this, what would I say to them?_

3. **Is There Really a Risk?**

   Sometimes, we let fear dictate how we act. Ask yourself: _What do I really gain from assuming this situation is risky or dangerous?_

These questions can help you get to the root of your anxiety and stop you from overthinking. Let’s explore how to apply these questions in three common life scenarios.

### Scenario 1: Overthinking in a Long-Distance Relationship (LDR) 💌

**The Situation:** You’re in a long-distance relationship, and your partner hasn’t been replying as quickly or energetically as usual. You’re worried this means something is wrong, or worse, that they’re losing interest.

**Applying the Questions:**

- **What’s truly at stake?**  
   You’re anxious that your partner’s slow responses mean they’re upset or disinterested. But what’s the hard evidence here? Have they said anything that confirms this, or is it just an assumption? Maybe they’re genuinely busy, tired, or dealing with their own stress. The relationship probably isn’t at risk just because of some low-energy interactions.

- **What would I tell a friend?**  
   If your friend told you their partner hadn’t been as responsive, you’d probably reassure them that it’s normal for energy to fluctuate, especially in long-distance relationships. You wouldn’t jump to conclusions. So give yourself that same advice—relationships have ups and downs, and not every moment needs to be perfect.

- **Is there really a risk?**  
   What do you gain from assuming your partner’s behavior is a sign of trouble? The truth is, jumping to conclusions can cause unnecessary anxiety and harm the relationship. Instead, try to focus on what’s _actually_ happening, and consider asking your partner how they’re feeling instead of overthinking.

By asking these questions, you can manage your anxiety better and avoid putting unnecessary strain on your relationship.

### Scenario 2: Low Self-Esteem in a New Place 🌍

**The Situation:** You’ve moved to a new place and are struggling to make friends. You’re starting to feel like there’s something wrong with you and that you’re just not good at connecting with people.

**Applying the Questions:**

- **What’s truly at stake?**  
   Your mind is telling you that you’ll never make new friends and that you’ll be lonely forever. But what’s the real evidence for that? Making friends in a new place takes time. Most people don’t form deep connections immediately, and there’s no proof that you’re incapable of building new friendships.

- **What would I tell a friend?**  
   If a friend came to you with the same problem, you’d likely remind them that it’s completely normal to feel out of place in a new city. You’d tell them to give it time and keep putting themselves out there, reassuring them that they’ll eventually find people who resonate with them. Offer yourself that same patience and understanding.

- **Is there really a risk?**  
   What do you gain from assuming you’ll never make friends? By thinking this way, you’re creating unnecessary pressure and isolating yourself further. The truth is, every new social opportunity is a chance to grow. Rather than focusing on the fear of rejection, shift your mindset to the opportunities that come with meeting new people.

By questioning these thoughts, you can boost your self-esteem and be more open to making connections.

### Scenario 3: Struggling to Find Part-Time Work 💼

**The Situation:** You’re an international student and you’ve been struggling to find part-time job opportunities. You’re starting to feel like you’ll never find work, and it’s weighing heavily on you financially and emotionally.

**Applying the Questions:**

- **What’s truly at stake?**  
   It feels like you’re failing because you haven’t secured a part-time job yet. But what’s the actual risk here? Will your entire academic or career future be derailed because of a delay in finding work? Chances are, there’s still time to find something, and there are many ways to make ends meet temporarily until you do. The stakes may not be as high as they seem.

- **What would I tell a friend?**  
   If a friend was in this situation, you’d likely tell them that job hunting takes time, especially as an international student navigating a new system. You’d encourage them to stay persistent and to keep trying, while also reminding them that their worth isn’t defined by whether they have a job right now. Give yourself that same encouragement.

- **Is there really a risk?**  
   Is there value in assuming you’ll never find work? Believing that you’ll fail will only drain your motivation. Instead, focus on what you can control—updating your resume, seeking advice from career services, or applying to jobs in different areas. By shifting your focus from fear to action, you’ll increase your chances of finding the right opportunity.

These questions can help you shift from a place of fear and frustration to one of persistence and resilience.

## Final Thoughts 🌟

Life is full of pressures, whether they come from relationships, self-esteem, or career challenges. But by asking yourself these three questions—_What’s really at stake? What would I tell a friend? Is there really a risk?_—you can take control of your anxiety and reframe how you approach the situation.

Remember, you have more power than you think to handle these challenges. With the right mindset, you can navigate tough situations with confidence, whether it’s a relationship worry, self-doubt in a new place, or career struggles. The next time you find yourself overwhelmed, take a step back, ask these questions, and give yourself the compassion and understanding you’d give to someone else.
