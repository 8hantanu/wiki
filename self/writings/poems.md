<hr>

## stagnant

Moved a thousand miles  
but not a slightest in the mind  
Spoke a thousand times  
But conveyed no thought of mine  
Toiled a thousand hours  
But not for dreams that were mine  
Change is the law of nature  
Yet here I am still feeling stagnant

<hr>

## bliss

Walking under the shining sun  
crunching over the dry leaves

<hr>

## feel or do

Speak for yourself  
Or speak for others  
Make for myself  
Or take from others  
For I am not sure  
If to find happiness within me  
Or in the happiness of others
