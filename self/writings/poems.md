# Poems ðŸŒ¼

## Stagnant

Moved a thousand miles
but not a slightest in the mind
Spoke a thousand times
But conveyed no thought of mine
Toiled a thousand hours
But not for dreams that were mine
Change is the law of nature
Yet here I am still feeling stagnant

## Bliss

Walking under the shining sun
crunching over the dry leaves

## Feel-or-do

Speak for yourself  
Or speak for others
Make for myself
Or consume from others
For I am not sure
If to find happiness within me
Or in the happiness of others
