# Work Over Self 🍱

The _"Work over self (and rest)!"_ is a way of life I came up with and strive to live by it.

As the phrase suggests, there are four categories:

- 💼 **work** - work related stuff
- 🛣️ **over** - everything in between
- 🪴 **self** - personal stuff
- 😴 **rest** - everything else

## The Philosophy 📜

"Work over self!" embodies two important ideologies:

1. 🧘‍♂️ **Self-Mastery and Growth**: Synonymous to _"Work on yourself!"_, this highlights the journey of self-discipline, self-reflection, and self-improvement. It’s about taking charge of one's impulses, reflecting on oneself, and striving to improve and live ethically and with integrity as a better version of oneself.

2. 🌱 **Commitment to Responsibilities**: On the other hand, this is synonymous to _"Putting work over yourself!"_, it's about prioritizing duties and responsibilities. This means putting effort into fulfilling tasks and achieving excellence, even if it means setting aside personal interests. It reflects a dedication to professional integrity and making meaningful contributions.

In essence, "work over self" encompasses both the internal process of self-improvement and the external commitment to fulfilling responsibilities and achieving goals.

## Time, Space and Matter 🌌

Based on this, I also organize my space, time and matter and live through it.

### Take your Time ⏳

Life's much easier to manage when time is organised. I try to time block my day into one of these four zones in which I can tune into. Each day is divided into multiple 4-hour blocks as seen in this daily schedule, with a transitory period between the time blocks:

| Time  | Zone  | Tasks                             |
|-------|-------|-----------------------------------|
| **Block I**   | 🌇 | **Dawn**                     |
| 05:00 | Self  | Study, Fitness, Growth            |
| 08:00 | Over  | Breakfast, Commute, Plan          |
| **Block II**  | 🏙️ | **Morning**                  |
| 09:00 | Work  | Projects, Tasks, Assignments      |
| 12:00 | Over  | Lunch, Walk, Powernap             |
| **Block III** | 🏙️ | **Afternoon**                |
| 13:00 | Work  | Meetings, Collaborations          |
| 16:00 | Over  | Log Tasks, Commute, Dinner        |
| **Block IV**  | 🌆 | **Evening**                  |
| 17:00 | Self  | Hobbies, Family Time, Relaxation  |
| 20:00 | Over  | Journaling, Reading, Hydrating    |
| **Block V**   | 🌃 | **Night**                    |
| 21:00 | Rest  | Sleep                             |

Below is the composition for the 24-hour day.

**Work (6 hours)**: Split into two 3-hour chunks focusing on professional tasks and responsibilities.

**Over (4 hours)**: Divided into four 1-hour transitions, crucial for shifting between different zones and activities, ensuring smooth adjustments and mental preparation.

**Self (6 hours)**: Reserved 3-hour in morning and in evening for personal growth, fitness, hobbies, and family time to foster individual well-being and fulfillment.

**Rest (8 hours)**: Dedicated solely to restorative sleep and relaxation, vital for maintaining physical and mental health.

### Separate your Spaces 🪧

In the same way, delineating specific areas for each zone helps me create an environment conducive to productivity and balance.

The **work**place, a space where most of my thoughts are put into action. Most of my screentime also happens in this place, and I avoid it after leaving this space.

The roads, the cafeteria, the campus etc again a sort of transitional space while moving **over** to the other spaces and places for intermediate rejunevation.

The park, the home, the retaurant, a place where I like to spend time with my loved ones, and pursue my **self**-growth and fulfilment.

The home, a space where I can come to anytime and its ready to embrace me in whichever state I am, where I can finally **rest**.

### Minimize your Matter 🎒

I consider myself a minimalist. I try to have as less of things as possible (and yes I keep count of it).

I organize my stuff both physical and digital into these categories (as seen in my [wiki](https://8hantanu.net/wiki)).

## How's it going? ✌️

In embracing "Work over self" philosophy I've found a harmonious rhythm that defines not just my daily routine but also my approach to life itself.

As I navigate each zone I've come to appreciate the clarity and efficiency that comes from organizing time, space, and matter. Each aspect of my environment, meticulously categorized and curated, is to support my journey towards both professional success and personal fulfillment. It also helped in creating good boundaries between the zones.

For me, "Work over self" is more than a schedule; it's a mindful practice that underscores my commitment to growth, responsibility, and well-being. It's in this balanced pursuit that I find not only productivity but also profound contentment and alignment with my values.
