# Work Over Self

The _"Work over self (and rest)!"_ is a way of life I came up with, based on which I organize my space, time and matter and live through it.

## The Philosophy

"Work over self!" embodies two important philosophical ideas:

1. **Self-Mastery and Personal Growth**: Synonymous to _"Work on yourself!"_, this perspective highlights the journey of self-discipline, self-reflection, and self-improvement. Itâ€™s about taking charge of one's impulses, reflecting on oneself, and striving to improve and live ethically and with integrity as a better version of oneself.

2. **Commitment to Responsibilities**: On the other hand, this is synonymous to _"Putting work over yourself"_, it emphasizes prioritizing duties and responsibilities. This means putting effort into fulfilling tasks and achieving excellence, even if it means setting aside personal interests. It reflects a dedication to professional integrity and making meaningful contributions in various aspects of life.

In essence, "work over self" encompasses both the internal process of self-improvement through reflection and the external commitment to fulfilling responsibilities and achieving goals.

## Organizing Time

Life's much easier to manage when time is organised. I try to categorise most of the time into one of the four categories. Each day is divided into multiple 4-hour blocks as seen in this daily schedule:

| Time  | Zone | Tasks                             |
|-------|------|-----------------------------------|
| **Block I**  | 
| 05:00 | Self | Study, Fitness, Growth            |
| 08:00 | Over | Breakfast, Commute, Plan          |
| **Block II** |
| 09:00 | Work | Projects, Tasks, Assignments      |
| 12:00 | Over | Lunch, Walk, Meditation           |
| **Block III** |
| 13:00 | Work | Meetings, Collaborations          |
| 16:00 | Over | Log Tasks, Commute, Dinner        |
| **Block IV** |
| 17:00 | Self | Hobbies, Family Time, Relaxation  |
| 20:00 | Over | Journaling, Reading, Hydrating    |
| **Block V**  |
| 21:00 | Rest | Sleep                             |

Below is the composition for the 24-hour day.

- **Work (6 hours)**: Split into two 3-hour chunks focusing on professional tasks and responsibilities.
- **Over (4 hours)**: Divided into four 1-hour transitions, crucial for shifting between different zones and activities, ensuring smooth adjustments and mental preparation.
- **Self (6 hours)**: Reserved 3-hour in morning and in evening for personal growth, fitness, hobbies, and family time to foster individual well-being and fulfillment.
- **Rest (8 hours)**: Dedicated solely to restorative sleep and relaxation, vital for maintaining physical and mental health.
