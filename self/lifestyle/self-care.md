# self-care

I have dry skin that is often exposed to the harsh effects of UV rays due to me being outside most of the time. The combination of sun exposure and environmental factors (mostly dust and pollution) leave my skin feeling dehydrated, rough, and prone to dryness. To combat these, I focus on hydration, protection, and gentle exfoliation as key elements in my skincare routine.

Most weeks, I try to follow my routine, but there are times when life gets busy and I’m unable to stick to it. However, I’ve learned that consistency is key; even if I miss a step or two here and there, staying committed to these routines most of the time still brings noticeable results. The small adjustments I make help me feel confident and refreshed, even when I can’t always follow the routine to the letter.
