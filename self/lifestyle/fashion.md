# the fashion

**The way I fashion!**

Okay, so the this page is supposed to be about my fashion sense and theory but I haven't added anything related to it yet, will do that soon.

Meanwhile you can check below how I handle my daily wear situation.

## the prime capsule closet

Daily fashion has always been hard for me. Standing in front of my closet every morning, trying to come up with good outfits, making combinations with whatever I had available. The decision fatigue was real. I'd spend way too much mental energy on something that should be simple.

I tried traditional capsule wardrobe advice, but I was never able to get the number of clothes down, neither was able to find good combos or ended up using my favorites for most of the time. There was still too much thinking involved.

### keep it simple silly (with math)

**NERD ALERT!!!**

Then I had this idea, what if I could use **coprime numbers** to create a perfect wardrobe rotation? 

Here's what I figured out. 

If M and N are coprime, and I have M tops and N bottoms, I can create M×N unique outfit combinations. On day D, I simply wear the (D%M)th top and (D%N)th bottom.

There is no need to do math every morning, there is a simple setup for this.

I arranged my clothes on a simple rack - all tops together, then all bottoms. My daily routine became:

1. Pick the **first top** and **first bottom**
2. At the end of the day, put them at the **back** of the line
3. Repeat

The math happens automatically through this physical rotation. I cycle through every possible combination exactly once before repeating.

### how i scale it to different situations

I've found this system works for various scenarios:

- **Weekend trips**: 2 tops and 1 bottom i.e. 2 fits over 2 days
- **Week-long travel**: 3 tops and 2 bottoms i.e. 6 fits over 6 days  
- **My standard setup**: 4 tops and 3 bottoms i.e. 12 fits over 2 weeks

Usually I stick with the above, but if you're adventurous then add in some layers for more combos.
- **A month?**: 5 tops and 3 bottoms and 2 jackets, then you've got 30 unique fits

I choose my numbers based on how long I'll be away and how often I want to do laundry.

### why this works for me!

So I use 4 tops and 3 bottoms combo. For me, I go out 6 out 7 days in a week, so this system works for a two weeks period perfectly!

Every piece gets used fairly. In my 4×3 system, each top gets worn exactly 3 times and each bottom 4 times before the cycle repeats. No more wearing out my favorite pieces while others sit unused.

The hardest decision I make is choosing my initial 4 tops and 3 bottoms at the start of every two weeks period. After that, my outfit is predetermined for the next two weeks. No more decision fatigue every morning.

After the end of the period, everything needs washing at the same time. It's like having a built-in laundry schedule. (Also I put aside pieces in laundry if I think they are due for one. Me no stinky!)

### my approach for too many clothes

Since I had way more than 4 tops and 3 bottoms when I started, I treat this system like A/B testing for my wardrobe.

Every two weeks, I pick any 4 tops and 3 bottoms from my collection and run the cycle. At the end, I keep the pieces I loved and swap out anything that didn't work. I repeat this every two weeks, gradually refining my way to my perfect rotation.

Also for **seasonal adaptation**, when seasons change, I simply swap out my rotation pieces. Tank tops and shorts for summer, sweaters and warm pants for winter. The mathematical framework stays the same, but my comfort adapts to the weather.

### my experience until now

I've been using my 4×3 system for months now. Sometimes the combinations look unexpected, but that's actually become one of my favorite parts, I've discovered outfit pairings I never would have tried otherwise.

The best part? I spend maybe 30 seconds getting dressed each morning instead of standing there overwhelmed by choices.

The clarity and efficiency I get from this organized approach aligns well with my broader philosophy of minimizing decision fatigue in routine tasks.
