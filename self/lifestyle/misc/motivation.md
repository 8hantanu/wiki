# Motivation

Write down exactly what you did today. Did you work? Did you rest? Did you argue? Did you feel fatigued? Did you eat right? Did you chip away at your creative project? Pretend you lived this day every day for the next 10 years. Where would you be? Healthier, more fulfilled? Sad, more complacent? You decide this now.
