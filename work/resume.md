## Experience

### Advanced Micro Devices

#### Sr. Software Engineer / Dec 2022 - Present / Hyderabad

- As part of AIG (Artificial Intelligence Group), implemented faster functionally-accurate simulation flow by leveraging a compiler-based approach to generate a functional core which replaces the cycle-accurate core while maintaining register information throughout the AI inference cluster.
- Achieved a significant milestone with over 100x speedup (days to minutes) in simulating ML networks on AI inference accelerators, thereby speeding the iteration cycles for developers working on the FlexML compiler.

#### Software Engineer II / Feb 2022 - Nov 2022 / Hyderabad

- Developed a multi-threaded cycle-accurate simulation framework which enabled parrallel execution of models while presenting a unified single-threaded application interface for simulation developers.
- Created cycle-accurate model of AI inference engines on this framework achieving scalable performance enhancements with increased thread counts and design complexities, yielding a 5-10x speedup compared to traditional SystemC models.
- Improved simulation accuracy and efficiency through model
optimizations and added many features which enabling debugging capabilities like selective VCD, zero-latency fast paths etc for the simulation model.

### Xilinx

#### Software Engineer II / Nov 2021 - Feb 2022 / Hyderabad

- Developed a transaction-accurate simulation flow with speedup of 10-100x while simulating HLS designs.

#### Software Engineer I / Aug 2020 - Sept 2021 / Hyderabad

- Developed SystemC models of IPs such as AXI Interrupt Controller, Clocking Wizard, and AXI Mailbox as part of the SW Emulation and Acceleration team.
- Created rigorous UVM test benches and modules for verifying mentioned IPs.

### Intel

#### Undergraduate Intern / Jul 2019 - Jun 2020 / Bangalore

- Developed the PCIe driver for enabling the hardware subsystem responsible for queue management in server SoCs.
- Enabled virtualization modes like Single-root IOV and Scalable IOV and interfaced user and test apps with the kernel module through IOCTL and sysfs for testing the subsystem's capabilities like FLR, MSI, and IOV.
- Designed DMA APIs to dynamically allocate and map memory in NUMA-based systems.
- Conducted multiple hands-on training sessions on Linux Kernel Modules and PCIe Device Drivers.

### AerospaceResearch.net

#### Open Source Developer / May 2018 - Aug 2019 / Google Summer of Code

- Developer and maintainer of VisMa and contributor to DirectDemod.
- Added CI, webhooks, and bots for automating workflow, code review, and unit-testing.
- Mentored and helped beginner developers delve into the world of OSS during GSoC'19.

### Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd - Aerospace Division

#### Summer Intern / May 2017 - Jul 2017 / Bangalore

- Collaborated with the team working on the electronic systems of L-40 strap-on boosters of GSLV Mk II.
- Learned about the control systems based on Strap-down Inertial Navigation system used in the third stage of GSLV.
- Produced a project report on the potential of harnessing solar energy at HAL.

## Projects

### CytoCube  / Apr 2019 - June 2019 / Dept of Instrumentation & Applied Physics, IISc, Bangalore

- Created control software for the prototype of CytoCube - a cost-effective, fast, and efficient flow cytometer.
- Integrated XIMEA cameras, optimized the code for camera and motor-axis movements increasing the speedup of blood scans by 5x, and assisted in PCB design.
- Automated the device setup flow, which previously required an equipment assistant to calibrate and setup the device.
- Trained an FRCNN based model to identify various blood cell types and get the blood count using OpenCV.

### 5-stage Pipelined MIPS Processor / Mar 2019 – Apr 2019 / BITS Hyderabad

- Designed a 32-bit 5-stage pipelined processor with forwarding and branch prediction supporting 20 different instructions (R-type, I-type, Jump/Branch) based on RISC ISA.
- Scripted a simple assembler in Python to generate bitstream for the instructions and implemented on the Spartan-3 FPGA board.

### Performance Optimization of MPI Parallel Code in FreeFlow / Aug 2018 – Nov 2018 / BITS Hyderabad

- Optimized code for mesh-free fluid-dynamics equation solvers using OpenMP and OpenACC pragmas to support hybrid parallelization along with MPI.
- Profiled the source code using Valgrind to detect memory leaks and PETSc to improve performance on parallel processors.

### VISual MAth / May 2018 – Aug 2018 / Google Summer of Code '18

- Developed a math equation solver and visualizer using Python with AerospaceResearch.net.
- Enhanced the GUI, added interactive graph plots, and added unit tests using pytest.
- Modified the codebase to follow the object-oriented style and created modules for functions, simplifier, calculus, solvers, and matrix.

### Operational Feasibility of Solar Power / May 2017 – Jul 2017 / Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd
